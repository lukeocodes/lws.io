Two-factor authentication refers to a pattern of users needing both something they know, like a password, and something they have, like a verification token from a mobile device.

This tutorial will cover how to implement a verification token system with the Vonage Verify API and Express.js.<!--more--> We have a similar Node.js tutorial using Koa - [you can find it here](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2019/04/15/how-to-add-two-factor-authentication-with-node-js-dr).

The application will have three pages - an initial page that asks for a mobile number, a page where users provide the code sent to them, and finally, a page which they'll see if their code was correct and the verification successful.

The finished code example is available at <https://github.com/nexmo-community/verify-node-express>

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
* A [Vonage API account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) - take note of your API Key & Secret on the dashboard

## Set Up

Create a new directory and open it in a terminal. Run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file and  install dependencies with `npm install express body-parser nunjucks nexmo`.

Create an `index.js` file and set up the dependencies:

```js
const app = require('express')()
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
const nunjucks = require('nunjucks')
const Nexmo = require('nexmo')
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }))
nunjucks.configure('views', { express: app })
const nexmo = new Nexmo({
  apiKey: 'API KEY FROM DASHBOARD',
  apiSecret: 'API SECRET FROM DASHBOARD'
})
// Other code will go here
app.listen(3000)
```

Nunjucks allows data to be passed to templates using the `{{ variable }}` syntax. It is set up to automatically parse files in the `views` directory and is linked with the express application stored in `app`.

## Create the Landing Page

Create a directory called `views` and an `index.html` file inside of it with the following content:

```html
{{ message }}

<form method="post" action="verify">
  <input name="number" type="tel">
  <button>Get code</button>
</form>
```

Create a route in `index.js` to render this view:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index.html', { message: 'Hello, world!' })
})
```

Run `node index.js` in your terminal and open `localhost:3000` in your browser. Notice that the message is populated at the top of the page in place of the `{{ message }}` in the code.

## Create a Verification Request

The form on `index.html` will send a POST request to `/verify` when submitted. Create a new route to handle this in `index.js`:

```js
app.post('/verify', (req, res) => {
  nexmo.verify.request({
    number: req.body.number,
    brand: 'ACME Corp'
  }, (error, result) => {
    if(result.status != 0) {
      res.render('index.html', { message: result.error_text })
    } else {
      res.render('check.html', { requestId: result.request_id })
    }
  })
})
```

By default, [workflow 1 is used](https://developer.nexmo.com/verify/guides/workflows-and-events), which sends an SMS, then calls to read out a code , and then another call. The final step will wait 5 minutes before the whole request expires. You can pass `workflow_id` as an option if you want to change this behavior.

The result will contain a `status` property - 0 means the action has been successful, and anything else means there has been an error - which is passed to the rendered `index.html` page. If successful `check.html` is rendered.

## Check the Code

Create `check.html` in the `views` directory:

```html
<form method="post" action="check">
  <input name="code" placeholder="Enter code">
  <input name="requestId" type="hidden" value="{{ requestId }}">
  <button>Verify</button>
</form>
```

As well as the code, the request ID is required to check if the code is correct. Using the same method as `{{message}}`, the value of the hidden field `requestId` is provided dynamically.

![Source code showing the request ID inserted as the value for the hidden input](/articles/vonage-2fa-express/enter-code.png)

Like before, this will submit a POST request to the `/check` endpoint as this is provided in the `action` attribute.

Create a new endpoint in `index.js`:

```js
app.post('/check', (req, res) => {
  nexmo.verify.check({
    request_id: req.body.requestId,
    code: req.body.code
  }, (error, result) => {
    if(result.status != 0) {
      res.render('index.html', { message: result.error_text })
    } else {
      res.render('success.html')
    }
  })
})
```

If the returned `status` is 0, the check has been successful and the verification is complete. Create a `success.html` file in the `views` folder to celebrate:

```html
<h1>ðŸŽ‰ Success! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
```

## What Next?

Congratulations on implementing 2FA. Hopefully, you'll agree that it was an enjoyable experience.

In production, there are some additional considerations you'll want to factor in:

- More robust handling of errors and non-zero status codes.
- Providing the ability to cancel ongoing verifications.
- Allowing users to indicate their preference between SMS and call-based code delivery.
- Use the Vonage [Number Insight API](https://developer.nexmo.com/number-insight/overview) to ensure only valid phone numbers are passed to the Verify API.
