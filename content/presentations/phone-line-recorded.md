title: Build a Call-In Phone Line With Pre-Recorded Messages
description: Learn how to accept incoming calls and respond with both a pre-recorded MP3 file and synthesised speech. In this project, we learn about Serverless using Netlify Functions, and utilizing Airtable as a database. The final project is a phone line which users can call to hear today’s MP3 ‘thought of the day’, with a fallback message read if there isn’t a recording for today.
